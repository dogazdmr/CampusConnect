## Motivation

  CampusConnect was created with a clear motivation: to enhance and simplify the university experience by providing a comprehensive, user-friendly platform for various community needs. Our goal is to foster a sense of belonging and convenience within the university community by addressing common challenges such as buying and selling second-hand items, recovering lost belongings, facilitating borrowing, and encouraging donations.

## Goals

- Enhance Campus Life: CampusConnect aims to make life on campus more convenient and enjoyable by connecting students, faculty, and staff through a shared marketplace and information hub.

- Solve Common Problems: We seek to address everyday challenges faced by the university community, including the hassle of finding second-hand items, recovering lost belongings, securing necessary study materials, and connecting with like-minded individuals.

- Promote Sustainability: By facilitating second-hand sales and encouraging donations, CampusConnect also contributes to sustainability efforts by reducing waste and promoting resource sharing.

## Important Problem

  CampusConnect resolves the issue of fragmented and inefficient communication and transaction processes on campus. Prior to CampusConnect, students and staff had to rely on disparate methods and platforms for buying/selling items, locating lost belongings, or finding suitable borrowing opportunities. Our platform centralizes these activities, making them more accessible and streamlined.

- Second-Hand Sales: Users can browse and list second-hand items by categories such as department, clothing, housing, etc., and utilize price filtering. Negotiable and non-negotiable listings are supported to accommodate various selling preferences.

- Lost and Found: CampusConnect helps users recover lost items by allowing people to post photos and details of found items. Listings include the number of days items have been in the system, with automatic removal of listings after 30 days.

- Borrowing: Borrowing options, both paid and free, are available to users, making it easy to find and lend items or services within the community.

- Donations: Users can access a donation list, particularly focusing on items related to approved school clubs, channels, and projects.

- Additional Features: CampusConnect goes beyond the basics, offering services for finding roommates, seeking tutoring, and more.
